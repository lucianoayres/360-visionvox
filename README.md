## About

360 VisionVox enhances the experience of watching YouTube 360-degree videos by enabling control through AI-powered voice commands and head movements. It utilizes TensorFlow.js for pose estimation and speech recognition, providing seamless interaction with the video player.

## Features

-   **Voice Commands**: Control video playback with voice commands such as Play, Pause, Stop, Next, and Back.
-   **Head Movement Controls**: Navigate 360-degree videos by moving your head in different directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Technologies Used

-   **TensorFlow.js**: Utilized for both pose estimation (head movement tracking) and speech recognition (audio classifier model).
-   **GitHub Actions**: Used for automated workflows, including deployment tasks.
-   **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Front-end development technologies for building the user interface and interaction logic.
